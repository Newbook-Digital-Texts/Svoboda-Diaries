      rounding Diala reach at

      having gone out in the desert

      races etc, & this caused a
      
      grave derangements in the
      
      intestines & caused vomiting;
      
     
     
      	The Mejidieh arrived at 7 ½

      	Light N.W. & fine weather,
      
      at 7 ½ am I called on Kerop
      
      Setyan  my Lawyer about
      
      the small house, he says that
      
      Emin wishes to have a settlement
      
      by paying him something,
      
      & if I allow him he will
      
      finish it with him that way
      
      
      & take an Ilam etc etc  ~
      
     
     
      	I came on board, we are
      
      alongside discharging Cargo;
      
     
     
      	They say we are leaving on Tuesday,
      
     
     
      	At 9 ½ I went to call on Menusha
      
      Henry’s wife & then went home,
      
      at 10 ½ I went to the office to
      
      see Mr. Parry & gave him the account
      
      for the value of the silver frame
      
      & links made by the Subba
      
      Silversmith Zahroon at Amara
      
      which came to
      
      4 Liras & 2 Kerans; I saw
      
      Alfred Holland in the Office,
      
      also Johnny Artin etc; I
      
      Came home at 11 am. I
      
      feel much headache & weakness,
      
      we breakfasted at 12
      
     
     
      	At 2 ½ P.M. in spite of my
      
      headache & giddiness, I went
      
      to take a warm water bath,
      
      We have taken away the stove
      
      & replaced the big Samawar
      
      instead, it got hot & the
      
      water in it also very hot,
      
      as the weather is very mild
      
      & warm; while I was washing
      
      I felt my head going round
      
      
      as if I was drunk; however
      
      I know that I still had the heache
      
      & cold in my head since I
      
      went down last week, but
      
      it seems that the warm
      
      water made it worse, I
      
      kept washing, but then I
      
      felt that I was getting worse
      
      & unable to continue, the
      
      doors of the bathroom being
      
      both secured inside, I tryed
      
      to rise up & open the door
      
      leading to our sleeping room
      
      but my head got so giddy
      
      & I was so week that I fell
      
      down flat on the dirty water
      
      which had now run down
      
      through the pipe because
      
      it had got chocked, I
      
      then sung out for the servant
      
      Zekki which did not
      
      answer, I then sung out
      
      for my wife Eliza about
      
      three or four times; then
      
      I ceased & lost conciousness
      
      lying flat on the ground,
      
     
     
      	I only felt some body
      
      
      trying to lift me up & that was
      
      all, I cannot recollect or
      
      feel how I was brought out
      
      to bed; I became conscious
      
      then in bed when I saw
      
      before me my wife, Alexander
      
      his wife Mary, Dowd Ghazala,
      
      also Antone Marine,
      
      & Eliza was putting my flannel
      
      & shirt on me, & they were
      
      giving me Ether sulphuric
      
      to drink & smell, & water
      
      thrown on my face,~
      
      It appears that our servant
      
      sung out to my wife that I
      
      was calling her, & Dowd
      
      Ghazalla has been with her
      
      talking, & they rushed on
      
      to see what is the matter
      
      & finding the door locked
      
      they went to the other one
      
      & with a knife lifted the
      
      hook & found me sensless
      
      on the ground & with difficulty
      
      thus lifted me up & with
      
      Alexander’s assistance they
      
      
      brought me to bed,  I
      
      then came to my sense & found
      
      relieved, & I was so astonished
      
      at what happened to me,
      
      without a serious cause for
      
      it, unless it is the cold in my
      
      head & the walk to town
      
      from Gherrara yesterday
      
      did it worse; as soon as
      
      I was put in bed I saw that
      
      Dr. Ramsay of the of the Residency
      
      surgeon was sent for by
      
      Antone Marine, he soon
      
      came , & I explained all to
      
      him & how I was unwell
      
      in the down trip & had fever
      
      & cold & was bilious etc,
      
      he sounded me, & then
      
      said that it was nothing
      
      he will send me a dose of
      
      Coslomel to take at bed time
      
      & must keep a strict diet
      
      taking nothing but Soup
      
      & milk, etc ~ How the news
      
      spred about the town is astonishing,
      
      all sent to ask about my state
      
      my sister Emilia, Mrs. Cowley
      
      
      Menusha, many other Christian
      
      people; even my sisters Eliza
      
      & Medula being out encamped
      
      in the Garden of Bahar
      
      sent at night to enquire;
      
      Antone came in the evening
      
      I took soup only, & some milk
      
      with sodawater~ at night
      
      before turning in I took the
      
      dose of Calomel~ I felt Sick

      Yacoob Oossy & Shekoory Sayegh,
      
     
     
      	This evening an awful Scene
      
      & a quarrel took place between
      
      my son & his wife on the one
      
      side, & my wife & myself,
      
      It appears that Marie has
      
      an awful hatered against
      
      my wife since 3 or 4 months,
      
      she is very contancrous and
      
      stuborn girl; it shows her
      
      meanness as far as family
      
      connextion is concerned,
      
      the cause of it this evening
      
      was, that my wife told me
      
      that it was not convenient
      
      for Marie to sew in her gown
      
      today being Sunday, &
      
      I told her this smilingly,
      
      she answered to me that
      
      this is from my wife that
      
      told me, & why then
      
      
      did, she wash clothes on
      
      Christmas even with an
      
      angry tone, & Alexander
      
      joined her, & both begun
      
      to talk impertinently, this
      
      made me enraged,& I
      
      talked strongly to them that
      
      this sort of misbahaviour
      
      cannot be tolerated; &
      
      she must hold her tongue,
      
      they both expressed their
      
      utmost sorrow for having
      
      come out here from Paris
      
      & had they known it so,
      
      they would not have come
      
      out; I told Alexander that
      
      he is at liberty to leave
      
      tomorrow if he likes, I have
      
      no impediment whatever,
      
      In fact this lasted an hour
      
      & made me so weak and
      
      disgusted, that none of us
      
      took any dinner; I felt
      
      so touched at what happened
      
      & so astonished at both
      
      
      Alexander & Marie's behaviour
      
      toward us, in a most daring
      
      & disrespectful way, she
      
      making expressions to my
      
      wife of being a lyer and
      
      other unbecoming words;

      of what he has caused last
      
      night, but my wife prevented
      
      me & so she & I sent for
      
      Antone Marine & explained to
      
      him all; he called Alexander
      
      & spoke to him & advised
      
      him to obey his father & mother
      
      & to reprimand his wife to
      
      keep the piece etc; but I
      
      was firm & would not accept
      
      all these promises unless
      
      I see Marie coming to her
      
      senses; & then I left the
      
      house, Antone squared it
      
      with Alexander & his mother
      
      & then Alexander brought
      
      
      his wife to kiss his mother etc,
      
     
     
      	I called on Henry on board
      
      the Khalifah & then we
      
      went to call on Mr. Rappaport
      
      but he was not at home,
      
      we went to Henry's home where
      
      I stayed & breakfasted;
      
      Came home at 1 P.M;

      at a distance of about 14
      
      days in land S. west of
      
      Basreh, this war has caused
      
      great political complication
      
      between the English and
      
      Turkish Government, the
      
      former is taking the part
      
      of Mubarek el Sobah on
      
      account of their aim to
      
      possess Kweit, & the latter
      
      is with the son of Rashid

      	At 6,,30 passed through
      
      the Bridge of Gherrara and
      
      then rounded & anchored
      
      just below it, & astern of
      
      the SS. Phrat which has
      
      been here since the 3rd Instt
      
      she has good many passengers
      
      & has to make 10 day’s
      
      
      Quarantine, where as Baghdad
      
      is declared contaminated
      
      this is very strange way of
      
      the quarantine regulation,

      Quarantine both ways,

      about five Zaptyes & a Turkish
      
      supposed to be a doctor & 2
      
      or 3 Guardians on the banks,
      
      what a stupid business
      
      they are carrying on, as the
      
      town of Baghdad is supposed
      
      by them to be infected they
      
      have no right to Object

      wont have it, saying that
      
      he had orders not to have any
      
      communication; They then
      
      brought a permit from Baghdad

      the two Tilkefly Guardians
      
      We have on board object to
      
      letting it come saying that
      
      they have orders from the
      
      
     
     
      	Inspector not to let anything
      
      come on board; Why did not
      
      Mr. Parry obtain order to do so
      
      from the Inspector, in fact
      
      all our passengers are well
      
      provided with provision for

      for an other ¼ of an hour; The
      
      awnings were furled & the Captain
      
      wont spread it, so the passengers
      
      get well socked & they got
      
      
      up a quarrel with the Captain for
      
      want of the awnings, but was

      I sent a letter to Alexander with
      
      Johny ~
      
     
     
      	At 3 ¼ P.M. two Goffas shored
      
      off from the quarantine station
      
      with the Turkish Doctor & the Clerk
      
      Raffooly Rasmachy etc & came
      
      alongside, they wont come on
      
      board but asked me to point
      
      out to them the rich passengers
      
      from the poor, I told him, I
      
      cannot tell them as I do not
      
      know who is rich & who is poor,
      
      they asked me the names

      for the wool Press also @ 37 ½
      
      P. & then all the rest were given
      
      free pratique, it is very
      
      unjust & have no right to charge
      
      because they did not land
      
      & no shelter or assistance were
      
      given to them; They gave about
      
      250 pratiques until 6 ¾ P.M.

      will wire to Basreh not to

      they again came back to give the

      that since there has been some
      
      cases of plague in the Town

      	Lynch’s Press cannot work
      
      
      here, the Eassayi's Press is working
      
      against it & cheaper, they are
      
      changing 14 R. Piasters less on
      
      each Bale than Lynch’s, &
      
      their Press is worked by Steam
      
      & Presses one foot less per
      
      Bale; So the merchants are
      
      nearly all gone over to Eassayi’s,
      
      The charge for pressing a Bale
      
      of Wool, all included gunny
      
      bags, bands etc is 5 ½ Beshlics

      by their Press, the Eassayis
      
      have a Hydrolic Press but
      
      is out of order; Here at
      
      Coot their Press is worked
      
      by Steam & can press 100
      
      Bales per day & smaller
      
      in Size, besides they have
      
      a large stowing place

      besides he gets 9 Piasters on
      
      each Bale pressed & he
      
      provides everything workmen
      
      fuel oil etc etc; The fuel
      
      I expect & as I am told
      
      gets it for nothing or
      
      for very little, as he burns
      
      the Liquorice which is brought
      
      down in Boats to him to
      
      be pressed & is piled up around

      & take his Kit from him
      
      
      I gave him a letter to Rufail &
      
      the sweetmeats & 2 Bottles Sirop
      
      that my wife is sending to Rufail
      
      & Tookyeh to take to them;
      
     
     
      	Breeze shifted to N.W. since
      
      7 AM & is cool; bu the heat
      
      of the desert is getting worse,
      
      The wind kept up all through the
      
      day but it got dusty so thick
      
      that the opposite side could
      
      scarcely be seen ~
      
     
     
      	I observed today that many
      
      people from Basreh & persons
      
      belonging to these high officials
      
      in quarantine have free
      
      access, they come & land &
      
      mix with them & then return
      
      to their Belems & go to Basreh,
      
      Some women the harem of
      
      Turkish officials were here
      
      about 10 of them since yesterday
      
      they went down in two Belems
      
      to Basreh, The Agent of the
      
      Turkish  Steamers Hassan
      
      Effendi & his staff are living
      
      here they go down to Basreh
      
      & came back & then go about
      
      among the Huts & pay
      
      
      visits to the official Turks,
      
      as the Defterdar , Said Pasha
      
      & Towfik Pasha, The people
      
      of the Mossul also land
      
      & go about the Huts & mix
      
      with the people, this is one
      
      of the worst quarantine
      
      that I have ever seen, no
      
      strictness or discipline is kept,
      
      only the employers exercise
      
      their absurd authority on the
      
      poor people; It cannot be
      
      called a quarantine; but
      
      only it is used as a pretext
      
      to extort money from the
      
      native Boats, so numerous
      
      as they are traficing up, &
      
      down the river & charging
      
      then at 1 ½ Mejidie each,
      
     
     
      	We have coaled the ship
      
      this afternoon taking 50 Tons
      
      from a Meheyla ~ They finished
      
      it at 9 P.M. ~
      
     
     
      	Modte N.W. wind but is not so
      
      refreshing & cool, I could not
      
      sleep well ~
      
      
     
    
    
     
      6 Thursd Th @ 5. 84
     
     
      	Light N.W. & fine, but not so
      
      cool; we are shipping cargo
      
      very slow work, There are 20
      
      Coolies in Barge but they are
      
      merely playing ~ our two
      
      mates are both ignorant & lazy,
      
      we have never had before such
      
      bad officers, Mr. Slack has only
      
      been here about 10 months
      
      & in always drinking & the other
      
      Mr. Mac Lure is a Young stupid
      
      man, & they have no one over
      
      them to put them to right, the
      
      Captain lets them do what they
      
      like, & does not care a bit about
      
      the interest of the company or
      
      has any ability for discipline;
      
     
     
      	At 9 ½ Rufail & Rezooki Angoorly
      
      came up in a Steam Launch
      
      of Angoorly, we were at breakfast,
      
      & they went on shore among
      
      the Huts to visit some friends,
      
      the Defterdar etc they came off
      
      to me at 10 ½ Rufail & Rezooki,
      
      They say that for the last 10
      
      days there has been no cases
      
      of Plague in Basreh; The mail
      
      Str. arrived yesterday ~
      
     
     
      	Rufail tells me that the
      
      Affair of Mubarek ibn Sobah
      
      
      Sheikh of Kweit & Sheikh
      
      Abdulaziz ibn Rashid of
      
      Shammar el Jebel, has taken
      
      a different phase, as the
      
      wali of Basreh Mohsen
      
      Pasha was ordered down to
      
      Kweit to see Mobarek & try
      
      to persuade him to be under
      
      the Turkish protection with
      
      all sorts of promises, but he
      
      did not succeed he was told
      
      plainly by Mobarek that should
      
      he requires any assistance
      
      or protection it must be under=
      
      stood by the Turkish Government
      
      that he will seek that of the
      
      English, & so Mohsen Pasha
      
      returned without having done
      
      any thing; The Mushir Pasha
      
      is here & will return next
      
      week to Baghdad; There
      
      are still 2 English men
      
      of war in Kweit watching
      
      events & Ibn Rashid is
      
      far in land about 7 days
      
      journey, ~
      
      
     
     
      	Rufail & Rezooki went away
      
      at 11 ½;
      
     
     
      	Weather became dusty the
      
      wind blowing strong N.W.
      
      this must be the Bareh
      
      wind which sets in about
      
      8th Instt when the Constellation
      
      of the Pleiades appears on the
      
      East ~
      
     
     
      	At 1 ½ P.m a letter came
      
      to Capt Hanslow from Mr. Bottomley
      
      telling him that at 4 P.M. the
      
      Stm. Launch will come up to
      
      us with the mail & our Barge
      
      in tow & must proceed up
      
      as soon as possible;  we
      
      were going to leave tomorrow
      
      just for no other purpose
      
      but so as to get up on
      
      Wednesday afternoon so
      
      as to be able to leave back
      
      on friday as Hanslow wished,
      
     
     
      	Some passengers are going
      
      on board the Mossul too from

      ready on the bank to go up
      
      with us ~
      
     
     
      	At 4 ½ P.M., the Stm. Launch
      
      came up towing our loaded
      
      Barge, only the Clerk of the
      
      Basreh Trading Copy Mr.
      
      came up to take their specie,
      
      & also Rezooki Sayegh
      
      came up to see me, he says
      
      since the 26 there have been

      They went away at 5, they
      
      also brought the mails
      
      & the S. Launch will return
      
      with Mr. Bottomley;
      
      We are getting some passengers
      
      from the quarantine, the Mossul

      & he wants me to put him in
      
      1st Class & charge 2nd fare
      
      because our 2 class was
      
      
      taken by Jews, I told him that
      
      I cannot do it without an
      
      order from the Agent Metty
      
      tryed & spoke to Capt' Hanslow

      pay as 2d fare, & so Bottomley
      
      told Capt Hanslow to let
      
      him do so; So Metty got

      	There is a rumour among
      
      the Christian people & my
      
      relatives too, that Sister
      
      
      Medoola wants to get married
      
      for the third time, & now
      
      with a young boy, Rezooki
      
      son of Risha Hanna Andria
      
      with a squint eye, he is
      
      about 36 or 37, & she is 58,
      
      he is marrying her for the sake
      
      of her money & the fine house
      
      she has; but I cannot make
      
      out why she wants to marry,
      
      probably because she is
      
      alone & lonely in the house
      
      & wants to have a companion
      
      but as it appears & she had
      
      always said before, that
      
      she will repent, we shall
      
      die if there is any truth in
      
      the rumour;

      you are old enough & can
      
      do what you like,

      he has fined her I think one
      
      Lira for having done so; and
      
      tells me it is the cause of the
      
      Bishop Aghnatius also for
      
      not informing him that he
      
      was going to marry her,

      of about 10 Liras for celebrating
      
      the marriage secretly, and
      
      with obtaining licence, as
      
      it is not allowed for a man
      
      to marry his uncle’s widow,

      as fire, In my cabin the iron
      
      & wood work is very hot to touch,
      
      In Capt Hanslow’s cabin up on Deck

      a little~ There are 344 Bales of
      
      Wool to be shipped; Here with

      & noise of the crowds of people
      
      filling the Ship, & no order or
      
      decipline; our two new
      
      mates Slack & MacLure
      
      & the Third Engineer Foreman
      
      
      who only joined last trip, were

      & playing instruments and about
      
      50 people looking at them through
      
      the windows, careless of the
      
      Bales of Wool coming on board
      
      they are left to be counted Simply
      
      by the deckmen; the Captain
      
      upstairs went to turn in, and
      
      such a scandal I never saw
      
      in my life having taken place,
      
      They are certainly encouraged
      
      to do so, seeing that the Captain
      
      takes no notice & lets them
      
      do as they like, but the worst
      
      is this young MacLure who takes
      
      such liberty, & brings aft his
      
      fellow scotch countryman
      
      the 3rd Engr. Forman, & they sit &
      
      talk, & the ship & Cargo are
      
      left to their faith; I could

      we finished shipping the wool
      
      at 10 ½ & lay rather close to

      English from taking possession

      us up at Ledje, should he
      
      get up there by noon I shall
      
      be waiting there, I made an
      
      error in not taking anything
      
      to eat but only two rusks,
      
      We walked across the desert
      
      with very little brushes, at
      
      half way I saw 7 Gazels on
      
      my left grasing, I managed
      
      to get pretty near, by dodging
      
      behind brushes & a mound
      
      but they saw me when I was
      
      about 200 yards & then I had
      
      to fire as they begun to turn back,
      
      I had a cartridge of No. 2 shots,
      
      but the range was too far
      
      for a smooth bore gun~
      
      I saw very few partridges at
      
      Oweyn, & started 2 hares,
      
      by 8 ½ we got above the
      
      creek/Nahar Shheyl) to
      
      the Lubia Cultivation, I
      
      
      had only 3 partridges, I shot
      
      well & the powder was very
      
      good, but the birds are scarce
      
      again this year; there is
      
      nothing to eat, every thing is
      
      dry & deserted; there has
      
      been no high rise last year
      
      & no cultivation ~ The watchman
      
      the Lubia Cultivation, I
      
      noon & after, the partridges
      
      came here in great number,
      
      I went out & walked up as
      
      far as the Pile of Liquorice,
      
      where Johnny & I encamped
      
      last October, but I saw
      
      very few, walked out in the
      
      desert, it was worse, no
      
      birds at all, I shot one,
      
      & lost a winged one; but I
      
      begun to suffer the great heat
      
      in the brushwood, & great pain
      
      on my Knews, I begun to feel
      
      very weak at 10 ½, the Bile
      
      getting stirred & the pain of
      
      my stomach begun, I returned
      
      to the Hut of the Lubia Man
      
      
      called Ihrisam, I could
      
      hardly eat a rusk, my
      
      mouth so dry that it wont
      
      go down unless I shove it with
      
      a sip of water, I took few
      
      drops of Arak once or twice
      
      the pain increased~ I went
      
      out to shoot at 11 I walked
      
      up & down, few partridges
      
      flew from the Lubia &
      
      no others, I shot two right
      
      & left barrels & both fell &
      
      were lost as they were winged
      
      It [strikethrough] was 2 P.M & no signs of
      
      the Mejidieh coming up, so I
      
      determined to return, but how
      
      was I to walk, I am so tortured
      
      most awfully, my knees are
      
      preventing me from making
      
      one step ahead; my feet
      
      both have got blistered
      
      from the rubbing of coarse
      
      stocking, & my weakness
      
      
      of stomach & pain, in fact
      
      I was done up, but I forced
      
      myself to walk back toward
      
      Oweyn, the heat is very
      
      intense, & so I used to sit
      
      on the bank & drink water,
      
      & wash & take 10 minutes
      
     
     
       rest & recommense walking,
      
      here I shot a Hare & an
      
      Other partridge, making
      
      in all 6 partridges & the
      
      Hare, & 3 which were winged
      
      & lost; But Oh my God
      
      the pain & suffering was
      
      so much that I could
      
      not possibly walk one
      
      step, my stomach got so sick
      
      that I wanted to throw up,
      
      At 3,,20 P.M. we were glad
      
      to see the Mejidieh coming
      
      up & rounding Rahmanyeh
      
      reach; we had to turn and
      
      walk up river, on account

      bitter, I was relieved from
      
      the pain &dosed off to sleep
      
      for about an hour, & then
      
      rose again & went out to the

      once every 4 or 5 hours, &
      
      the other for stopping the
      
      diarrhea should be necessary
      
      to stop it, but when I
      
      took the quinine it brought
      
      on the pain in my stomach

      are coming to town tomorrow,
      
     
     
      	I am so weak & lost my
      
      head, I forgot my illness,
      
      & cannot touch any food,
      
      This is my last brother
      
      that I have lost, poor

      much like a child, & poor
      
      children of my brother are mad
      
      & inconsolable ~
      
     
     
      	Monsr. Rouet the french Vice Consul
      
      called on us to condole;
      
     
     
      	I hired a Boat for 3 Mejidies to
      
      go down to Gherrara& bring
      
      the Kit tomorrow;
      
      Artin my nephew called ~ also
      
      Eliza & Adoola, & Johny Pehlawan,
      
      his uncle Selman (brother of
      
      his mother Farida) died yesterday
      
      afternoon he is about 75 years
      
      Old;

      weather ~ I took only soup
      
      & boiled chicken for dinner,
      
      & the pain came on just
      
      
      as before, troubling me very
      
      much; I am taking the
      
      Vals water, I feel it agrees
      
      with me; at night it pained
      
      me fearfully ~
      
     
    
    
     
      19th Satur
     
     
      	My stomach worked at 4 am
      
      very loose, black & billious
      
      with offensive smell ~ I
      
      felt relieved from the gastric
      
      pain ~
      
     
     
      	My birth day today, born
      
      in 1840 ~
      
     
     
      	At 6 ½ am our Kit from
      
      Gherrara arrived in the Boat;
      
     
     
      	Mahomed the Hamal of
      
      my brother & others, have brought
      
      Menusha & her son Antone
      
      to Gherrara yesterday evening
      
      at about 5 P.M. they caught
      
      up the Mejidieh at Thaji
      
      early in the morning, having just
      
      got underway, from Dawar
      
      & as she passed Rwebyeh, they
      
      saw the three horsemen on the
      
      beach of Thaji,
      
      
     
     
      	Mr. Rappaport came to me,
      
      he wishes to know when Menusha
      
      is coming to town because
      
      he wants to go to the house
      
      & make an Inventory, or
      
      if she does not come today, he
      
      shall have to seal the rooms
      
      until she comes, because
      
      all Henry’s children are
      
      under age; He wants Yousif
      
      Yaghchi to Come to town so
      
      as to act as procurator;
      
      or Azoory (Menusha’s brother)
      
      as I cannot be on account
      
      of my constant absence
      
      from town; ~ So Mr. Rappaport
      
      went & took Azoory Chanteduc
      
      also Alexander my son to be
      
      as witness, & overhauled all
      
      my brother’s Kit in the room, his
      
      clothes & every thing, was taken
      
      note of, & written down; This
      
      is too much I detest such a
      
      law as this; the Austrians are
      
      more severe in this sort of
      
      business than any other
      
      Nations ~
      
      
     
     
      	Eliza my wife came from
      
      Gherrara at 10 am, with her
      
      servant Zekky ~
      
     
     
      	My bowels worked three times today
      
      very loose & with bile & dark coffee
      
      colour & I still have the pain,
      
      I am taking no medicine, it
      
      is a wonder how much Bile
      
      I have; ~ At dinner I took soup
      
      rice made with it & little boiled
      
      fowel; I took a glass of the
      
      Vals water with wine; but
      
      as I felt it [strikethrough] heavy on me,
      
      I took a mixture of my old
      
      Medicine Sulphur & cream
      
      of Tartar, when I went to bed
      
      I could not sleep from the pain
      
      in stomach like a boil & heavy,
      
      I kept suffering until midnight
      
      the gastric juice coming up
      
      to my throat & I felt sick,
      
      when I got up, I hove all
      
      the contents of my stomach
      
      in the verandah; Still I was
      
      not relieved from the pain,
      
      it troubled me all the rest of
      
      the night, & not having been
      
      
      able to sleep a wink;
      
     
    
    
     
      20 Sund
     
     
      	Light n.w. & fine cool morning
      
      I feel so weak that I could
      
      not dress & go to Menusha
      
      where all my relations have
      
      gathered, she came in last
      
      night in a carriage from
      
      Gherrara, with her brother
      
      Azoory, her son Antone the
      
      eldest of 17 years & Harriet,
      
      my wife, Alexander & Marie
      
      went to church & thence
      
      went to my brothers house,
      
      there were sisters Eliza, & Emilia,
      
      & all the rest;
      
     
     
      	I feel calmed & no pain,
      
      I took Tea; & at  noon took
      
      only rice soup; People called
      
      on us to condole; ~
      
     
     
      	Eliza, Alexander & Marie went to
      
      Menusha where my sisters & their
      
      children were & others; ~
      
      Tomorrow a high mass is to be
      
      celebrated for the repose of my
      
      brother Henry, a circular
      
      made out out & sent round
      
      to all the Europeans etc;
      
      
     
     
      	I took my dinner only Soup
      
      & some arrow root; but felt
      
      the food heavy in my stomach
      
      & prevented me from Sleeping
      
      when by midnight, the Shooting
      
      pain begun to prick; I
      
      took Fruit Salt; Effusion
      
      of Cammomile flower, but
      
      to no use, & so could not
      
      sleep till day break;
      
     
    
    
     
      21 Mond Th@6. 67
     
     
      	Light n.w. & fine cool
      
      morning; we took tea & at 7 ½
      
      am we all went to my brother’s
      
      house, but the weeping &
      
      yells of Menusha & my sisters
      
      as soon as they saw me
      
      was very heart rending;
      
      I could not keep myself from
      
      the bitter weeping; At 8 we
      
      all went to the Latin Church
      
      many people were there, also
      
      Mons Rouet, (Mr. Rappaport
      
      was absent out at Gherrara)
      
      after the prayers we came back
      
      to the house; where all the
      
      
      Christians called, also Mons
      
      Richarz the German Consul,
      
      but no other Europeans or
      
      Englishmen; at 11 ½ I
      
      & Eliza came home as I could
      
      not resist longer, being very
      
      weak & hungry; ~ Antone
      
      Marine is the only family left
      
      encamped at Gherrara, he did
      
      not come in, or called today;
      
     
     
      	My pain came on this afternoon
      
      very bad, & I sent Alexander to Dr.
      
      De Silva of the Comet to ask him
      
      for a mixture of Assafoetida
      
      which used to do me good before,
      
      I took half a wine glass; it seemed
      
      to have allayed the pain,
      
      but while Johny was here, I
      
      took just one sip of arak
      
      & water & the pain came
      
      on worse than before, I took
      
      soup, but to no effect; at
      
      night I was dying from it,
      
      took Fruit salt, & put
      
      hot salt & brand on my belly,
      
      I neverfelt it so bad in
      
      my life & no sleep at all,
      
      even I took hot soup
      
      
      at midnight, it used to go &
      
      come back;
      
     
    
    
     
      22 Tuesd
     
     
      	S.Erly breeze & cloudy; ~
      
     
     
      	Toward 4 am the pain calmed
      
      down & I slept for about 3
      
      hours; ~ I sent to ask if
      
      Dr. Ramsey is receiving patients
      
      & Hannosh his man said
      
      that at 10 am. & he will send
      
      me word;~
      
     
     
      	The S.S. Mossul left yesterday
      
      for Basreh~
      
     
     
      	At 11 ½ I went to Dr. Ramsey
      
      & related to him about my
      
      stomach ache, he tapped my
      
      stomach & he recommended
      
      me not eat every thing, only
      
      soup, Rice pudding & so on
      
      & drink milk & soda; and
      
      prescribed two Bottles of each
      
      one table spoonful mixed
      
      together which will cause
      
      an effervesence to be taken
      
      before each meal, & not
      
      to sleep so soon after
      
      
      meal but to give about 3
      
      hours time to digest, & a
      
      little Cognac with water
      
      at meal; & that is all, I
      
      paid him fees of ½ Lira;
      
     
     
      	Mr. Rappaport called on
      
      me, he wants me to act as
      
      Tutor or guardian [strikethrough] in
      
      the affair & estate of my
      
      brother Henry, jointly with
      
      his wife Menusha, as she
      
      preferred so; ~ I went then
      
      at 1 ½ P.M. he was there
      
      with his Dragoman & papers
      
      etc, & making and inventory
      
      & estimation of all the
      
      effects furniture etc, being
      
      estimated by Rezooki Tessy
      
      hired for the purpose;
      
      In his library room (that which
      
      used to be my fathers) is found
      
      in a small box his valuable
      
      papers as the Hyjeh of the House,
      
      his Passport & other papers;
      
      Mr. Rappoport suggested to me that
      
      it would safer if he takes them
      
      under his charge if his wife
      
      consents, but she & I preferred
      
      
      that she should keep them
      
      under key; I signed all the
      
      papers as well as Menusha
      
      did, as the papers of procuration
      
      & gave me one; He left
      
      at 3; People are still calling
      
      for condolence;
      
     
     
      	The Khalifah has arrived
      
      at Gusseiba; & a letter came

      him that my brother arrived
      
      there ill & was taken to
      
      Rufails house; he does not
      
      say further of his death;
      
     
     
      	At 4 P.M. the S.S. Khalifah arrived
      
      Faraj the assistant Clerk sent me
      
      two letters from Rufail & Rezooki
      
      Sayegh in which they relate
      
      to me the sad news of my brothers
      
      death on the 17th at 11 A.M.
      
      It appears that he felt unwell
      
      two days before arrival
      
      
      at Basreh, he had landed
      
      to shoot at Gusseiba on the
      
      day of their leaving Baghdad
      
      & then he felt ill & had fever
      
      & when they were at Amara
      
      on Monday night, he
      
      had a fit & fell down from

      the Khalifah arrived at 3 am
      
      & Mr. Bottomley & the doctor

      very seriously ill; He was
      
      taken on shore to Rufails
      
      house & treated there, but he
      
      was speechless, he must have
      
      got his old sickness of last
      
      year, something like a Congestion
      
      of the Brain; and on
      
      
      Thursday at 11 am he died,
      
      His body was towed up by

      to allay the pain, Dr Ramsey’s

      way, it is sending the pain
      
      up my throat, I am throwing
      
      Saliva constantly & the

      when she went across to London
      
      to see my son Alexander last
      
      year; I explained to him the
      
      matter, & he does not attach
      
      any importance to her Claim,
      
      as I am going to him tomorrow

      sealed up with him, he told
      
      me that he will make out
      
      the answer simply in the way
      
      
      of a Process Verbal, saying
      
      that I do not owe Blanche
      
      any thing at all, & if she chooses
      
      to open a process against me
      
      she will have to nominate
      
      her lawyer in Baghdad,

      & returned at 10 ½; & left it

      felt unwell after leaving

      fit & the Congestion of the
      
      brain which rendered him
      
      Senseless; & it may be through

      At 5.40 stopped at the shoal of
      
      Zumbaranyeh & sent to sound;
      
      marked the Channel;~ We could
      
      not pass, & it became dark; sent
      
      to sound again; we remained here
      
      for the night;~
      
     
     
      	I took in my cabin some rice soup
      
      & had a leg fog boiled fowel, I have
      
      no appetite to eat, feeling very
      
      thirsty, I sucked an orange
      
      but my stomach aches me like
      
      a boil, but not in the intestines,
      
     
     
      	as soon as I turned in the pain came
      
      in my Stomach very bad and prevented
      
      me from sleeping, not only it, but

      up in his cabin, & Mr. Darby all
      
      had tuned in, & these three persons
      
      were making a hell of a raw
      
      so that Capt Hanslow came
      
      down twice to stop them but
      
      they did not, some time they go to
      
      Maclure’s Cabin, sometime to

      paid the rest of some peoples
      
      wages; I called on Mr. Rappaport,
      
      about my brother’s affair; Mr.
      
      Rappaport, seeing me so suffering,
      
      he advised me to ask for leave
      
      & stop behind; I left him &
      
      went to the office to Mr. Perry to
      
      get 50 £ for the wages of officers,
      
      I complained to him about my
      
      servant Hamadi; being so lazy
      
      so helpess & has not seen him
      
      since we arrived, he is getting
      
      so old & cannot work any
      
      more; Mr. Perry said that I
      
      should report him to the Captain
      
      & this latter must refer it to me,
      
      if Hamadi is found to be unfit
      
      for service, another one must
      
      be found to replace him,
      
      
     
     
      	He asked me how I was feeling
      
      & if I am well, I told him that
      
      I have again got the illness of my
      
      stomach & do not feel well at
      
      all; he offered me if I like to
      
      stay behind & have a leave so
      
      as to get well, I thanked him
      
      & asked him for one month’s
      
      leave, he gave it to me, & so I
      
      left & came home at noon,
      
      I had a quarrel with our Servants
      
      & had to thrash the boy Monsoor
      
      for not having got the breakfast;
      
     
     
      	Sister Emilia & Alice called &
      
      I had to leave there at 2 P.M. &
      
      go on board, so as to square &
      
      Balance last years’ account
      
      in the Cash Book; & to send my
      
      Kit home; while doing so,
      
      I thought of taking a dose
      
      of Fruit Salt so as to work
      
      my bowels more freely; but
      
      soon after I took it, a terrible
      
      pain or cramp caught
      
      
      me in the intestines in the lower
      
      part of my belly, such as
      
      I never in my life has had,
      
      it made jumping like mad,
      
      the pain was so severe and
      
      cutting as if my guts were burning,
      
      Alexander my son was on
      
      board but he was out in the
      
      saloon; I called Metty for
      
      help, he came, & gave me a
      
      doss of Ginger but it made
      
      me worse, I felt as if I was
      
      dying, the ship’s money &
      
      papers all scattered about,
      
      I was rolling in bed like
      
      a poisoned man, many
      
      people gathered in my cabin
      
      I told Metty & Alexander
      
      to send for Doctors, they did
      
      I got hot towels immersed in
      
      very hot water put on my
      
      belly. Père Pierre came by
      
      chance to see me & he helped
      
      them too; D.r De Silva of the
      
      Comet came, he administered
      
      
      Laudanum etc; all to no use,
      
      at last I preferred to vomit,
      
      & they gave me hot water I
      
      vomited; my wife heard about
      
      me & she came on board,
      
      and toward evening I felt
      
      the pain better, they took me

      	VIENNE, 8 juillet. – Il est manifeste que
      
      l’Allemagne est peu satisfaite de l’état ac-
      
      tuel des choses sur la côte occidentale du
      
      golfe Persique. Cela ressort nettement
      
      aussi bien des nouvelles reçues de Lon-
      
      dres relativement aux démarches faites
      
      par l’ambassadeur de Turquie pour éta-
      
      blir les droits du sultan sur une localité
      
      située dans le voisinage de Koweyt, que
      
      d’autres renseignements encore reçus à
      
      Vienne.
      
     
     
      	Toutes les informations provenant de
      
      cette partie de l’Asie-Mineure, qu’elles
      
      émanent de source indépendante ou de
      
      source allemande, s’accordent à mettre en
      
      évidence les embarras que cause aux con-
      
      cessionnaires du chemin de fer de Bagdad
      
      l’épineuse question de Koweyt. Abdul
      
      Hamid et la Porte ont été prêts et sont
      
      d’ailleurs toujours prêts à faire tout leur
      
      possible pour faire aboutir un projet qui
      
      semble offrir de grands avantages écono-
      
      miques et qui a en même temps une
      
      grande importance au point de vue stra-
      
      tégique.
      
     
     
      	Cependant, au moment où la réalisation
      
      de ce projet paraissait assurée, on a cons-
      
      taté tout d’un coup que le cheikh local,
      
      qui s’était placé sous la protection de la
      
      Grande-Bretagne, repoussait la souverai-
      
      neté du sultan sur Koweyt, le seul en-
      
      droit qui réunisse toutes les conditions
      
      nécessaires pour l’établissement d’un port
      
      terminus sur le golfe Persique.

      terminus sur le golfe Persique.
      
     
     
      	Il est assez évident que l’impossibilité
      
      de trouver une autre localité pour rempla-
      
      cer Koweyt de façon satisfaisante consti-
      
      tue la véritable cause de l’intérêt insolite
      
      que prend la Porte aux conflits des diffé-
      
      rents chefs arabes, conflits auxquels, en
      
      temps ordinaire, elle s’intéresserait cer-
      
      tainement fort peu.
      
     
     
      	C’est à l’influence allemande qu’il faut
      
      attribuer les démarches diplomatiques
      
      faites à Londres et les tentatives des
      
      fonctionnaires turcs pour créer des diffi-
      
      cultés aux représentants de la Grande-
      
      Bretagne en Asie mineure.
      
     
     
      	On mande de Bassorah à la Correspon-
      
      dance politique que des dissentiments se
      
      sont élevés entre le vali (le général Mus-
      
      tafa Nuri pacha) et le consul anglais M.
      
      Wratislaw, que le vali accuse d’avoir trou-
      
      blé la paix et d’avoir excité l’un contre
      
      l’autre les chefs Ibn Rashid et Moubarakh.
      
     
     
      	Le vali a insisté pour que l’on de-
      
      mande au gouvernement anglais le rappel
      
      de M. Wratislaw.
      
     
     
      	Voici une autre nouvelle, provenant de
      
      Constantinople, que l’on publie ici ce soir :
      
     
     
      	« Abdullah pacha, chef militaire du ter-
      
      ritoire de la côte de la mer Rouge, sous le
      
      prétexte d’une tournée d’inspection, s’est
      
      enfui à bord d’un steamer anglais en em-
      
      portant tous les fonds dont il était respon-
      
      sable. Il est actuellement à Aden. Les An-
      
      glais ont fait là un coup de maître, car
      
      Abdoullah connaît à fond le pays et dis-
      
      pose d’un grand nombre de partisans. »
